# Mailcatcher Docker

This repo is a simple docker example that runs 'mailcatcher'.
It's based on official 'ruby' image.

Look inside & run:

    ./create_container
    ./start_container
    
# Mailcatcher

MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface.
It's really great for development when you want to test SMTP all the way...
